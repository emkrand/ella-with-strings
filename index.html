        <div class="column right"><h2>Artist Bio:</h2><p>Ella Rand is a singer-songwriter from Hood River, OR. She began playing guitar in her Junior year of high school and fell in love with the instrument.
        She is currently in college, and writes heartfelt songs about her experiences as well as those of the people around her. "I use music to work through my emotions," she says.
        " and sometimes they come out on the other side as something worth sharing." With sweet melodies and soft strumming, Ella brings her experiences close to the heart of her listeners.</p></div>
